        <h2>This is the absolute BEST Alfredo Sauce!</h2>
          <p>I found this Alfredo sauce recipe on Allrecipes a few years ago and have made it too many times to count because it's that good and oh so easy to make.</p>
          <p>It only takes about twenty minutes to make from start to finish and uses only five ingredients.</p>

            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in cream and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cheese and garlic; whisk continuously until heated through. Stir in parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
